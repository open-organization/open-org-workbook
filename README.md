This respository contains files related to _The Open Organization Workbook_ (working title), the forthcoming community-produced companion to Jim Whitehurst's 2015 book, _The Open Organization_ (Harvard Business Review Press).

## About the book

_The Open Organization Workbook_ is the sixth book in [the _Open Organization_ book series](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/book-series) from Opensource.com. It speaks specifically to ways individuals, teams, and organizations can transform organizational cultures, and serves as a handbook-style resource people can use while they're undergoing culture change initiatives aimed at cultivating open environments.

Divided into five units—each one pertaining to a different characteristic oultlined in [The Open Organization Definition](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/open-org-definition)—the book features three principal types of material: 

- **Introductions,** which elaborate the nature of a given open principle and explain its value for organizations that might adopt it
- **Case studies,** accounts of various organizations enacting open values at scale
- **Exercises,** activities teams can perform to better understand and practice open values at scale
